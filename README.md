Posted the code I have to github for my MtG Collection site. It is currently being hosted on repl.it as I don't own or feel comfortable securing, maintaing, and protecting my own web server currently, not to mention it'd probably cost me money I might not want to spend right now.

I've noted that I might need to look into module scripts for importing all of the cards for each page rather than manually write out the code for each script that loads the cards for each page.

This is also my first experience with javascript, in about a week this is the CSS, JS, and HTML I came up with for this project. I can see myself working on this project for a long time since I don't see myself stopping playing or collecting MtG. Some future additions I'd like to see myself add are as follows:

: Add the deck for each commander, add cards I'm looking at for the deck, add a total price of the deck and each section, add the ability to save the previous days value and compare to the next day for a total % increase/decrease on the deck's worth.
: Add another section to the main page where you can view every single card I own, and again do a total % increase and decrease for the previous day(s) value(s) to see how much my collection has shifted. 
: Make the background for each page the colors the commander represents, and make the background move infinitely up/down seamlessly so that the page doesn't look entirely static.
: Make the site have a loading animation for every single card image and price so that the site doesn't look blank when it's requesting data from scryfall.
